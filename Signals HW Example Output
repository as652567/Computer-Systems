Signals HW Example Output: 

Running program to simulate a typical daemon process
Main program sleeping for 10 seconds to simulate initialization of daemon process
Parent PID = 4583
Parent forking child process...
Parent: going to sleep for 2 minutes
Child process created with pid: 4584
Child: process executing
Child: going to sleep for 30 seconds...
Child: process exiting
Sending signal to parent process...Parent: getting exit status of child
Parent: child pid upon return is 4584 and exit status is 53

Question: When the parent sleeps for 2 minutes how long does it actually sleep and WHY? 
The parent sleeps until interrupted by the signal, triggered by the end of the child process code execution

BONUS: How to get the parent process to actually sleep for 2 minutes.
Use sleep(120) prior to waitpid() call and do not send any signal to end the sleep() of parent process
